                Steve. One  thing they all have in common — from personal friends to colleagues to owners of Apple
                products — is how they’ve been touched by his passion and creativity. You can view some of these
                messages below.And share your own at <a href="rememberingsteve@apple.com">rememberingsteve@apple.com</a></pre>

                <h2>So appropriate</h2>
                <pre>I was sitting at my Windows PC getting stuff ready for tomorrow when I get a pop up alert from CNN on
                my iPod to say Steve had passed. I can't help thinking that somewhere Steve is saying, "Yeah, that's
                what I'm talking about!" Steve, people will remember you as a genius but it will be the absence of your
                vision that the world will miss the most. Heaven is in for one heck of a makeover! </pre>

                <h2>too great a loss</h2>
                <pre>Few people change the world, Steve did. My sincerest condolences to his family, friends and the
                world.</pre>

                <pre>Very said day for our World. Steve indeed will be missed as he is and always will be APPLE! REST IN
                PEACE GENIUS! </p>
